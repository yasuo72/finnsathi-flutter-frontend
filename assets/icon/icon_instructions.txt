To create your custom app icon for FinSathi:

1. Create two PNG image files in this folder:
   - icon.png: A square image (1024x1024px recommended) for your main app icon
   - icon_foreground.png: The foreground layer for adaptive icons on Android 8.0+ (should be 108x108dp)

2. Use a financial theme that represents your app (coin, wallet, chart, etc.)

3. After creating these files, run the following command to generate all the required icon sizes:
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

This will replace the default Flutter icon with your custom FinSathi icon on both Android and iOS.

Tips for a good app icon:
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Use your app's color scheme (#4866FF blue is already configured)
- Make sure it looks good at small sizes
- Test it on different backgrounds
